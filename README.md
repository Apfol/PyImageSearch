1. FaceDetect.py: This is the implementation of the face detection in images, and the path to the image is all that is to be provided. The confidence value can optionally also be included when this file is run from Command Prompt, use -c to do so.

2. VideoFace.py: This is the real time implementation of face detection in video taken from the default camera of the system. The confidence value may also be optionally provided when this file is run from Command Prompt, use -c to do so.

3. objectDetect.py: This is the real time implementation of Object detection in video taken from the System's default camera. The confidence value, again, may be provided by running the file from Command Prompt, using the "-c" argument to do so.
